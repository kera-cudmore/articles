I previously gave some recommendations for podcasts aimed at junior developers that cover a wide range of topics, perfect for someone just starting out in the industry - if you missed it, you can view it here: [8 podcasts perfect for junior developers](https://www.codu.co/articles/8-podcasts-perfect-for-junior-developers-390jsuhc).

I'm currently learning ReactJS, so I've researched some podcasts aimed specifically for developers with an interest in JavaScript and ReactJS. I've chosen these four podcasts as they are still currently creating episodes - but do let me know in the comments if there are any other podcasts on JavaScript or React that I might have missed!
