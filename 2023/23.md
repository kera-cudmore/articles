# üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Favicon Generators

### What is a Favicon?

A favicon is a fun little icon that promotes brand recognition and trust in your website. It can also help users easily identify your site in their address bar, bookmarks or in the sea of tabs they have open.

A favicon can also indirectly affect your sites SEO. Some search engines display the favicon with the search results, and having an eye-catching favicon could improve your click through rate!

Adding a favicon to your site doesn't have to be difficult, and I've rounded up 5 sites for you to use to create your next custom favicon!
