It's almost that time of year when developers start to think about signing up for Hacktoberfest -  but if you're a new developer, you may be wondering what is Hacktoberfest, and why would I want to contribute to open source? Well read on to find out why open source is so important to the web.

## What is Open Source

Unlike proprietary software which is kept private and has strict license requirements, open source is developed as a public, open collaboration and made freely available to the public. This allows anyone to inspect, modify, learn from and enhance the source code of open source projects.


## So What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an annual worldwide event held during the month of October that encourages developers to contribute to open source projects. And this years event is special, as Hacktoberfest is celebrating its 10th Anniversary!

Open source projects maintained by community-minded coders, are a big part of what makes the modern internet function. Supporting this essential work and the developers behind it, is what Hacktoberfest is all about.


## Sounds cool - so how do I take part?

Developers can sign up to participate in Hacktoberfest anytime between the 26th of September and the 31st of October.

Then, you will need to produce four pull requests in projects participating in Hacktoberfest, and have those PR's accepted by the maintainer during the event (1st to 31st of October).

Everyone is welcome, from new developers to those who have participated every year since it began, and there are even tasks for non-coders too!

It's important to remember that **quality > quantity** - make sure that you are making meaningful contributions, as they will make a lasting effect on the projects you work on.
