Lorem ipsum is a short paragraph of text which contains all the letters of the alphabet, and the characters are spread out evenly so that the reader's attention is focused on the layout rather than the content. It has been the standard dummy/placeholder text used in the printing and typesetting industry since the 1500‚Äôs.

Sometimes developers need to use placeholder text - to enable them to visualise the layout of a site before the final content is ready. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to stick with the somewhat boring lorem ipsum text. I‚Äôve scoured the web and found some interesting alternatives for your next project!
